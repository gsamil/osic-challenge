# osic-challenge

This is CNN classifier implementation for [OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression](https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression) using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library. It is not very successfull, but it is a good implementation for a classification problem. It uses PyTorch Dataset and pandas DataFrame to read and store data.

[model.py](./model.py) class also contains Feed Forward and ResNet models.
